# Flask + Descope Authentication (and a little bit of React) 

Using the Python framework Flask + React.js + Descope Python SDK to add and manage basic authentication, tenants, and roles!

<br>

## Installing Dependencies üõ†Ô∏è

### Frontend Setup

1. install dependencies: ```npm run setup``` 
2. In ```package.json``` add the following to allow react to access our flask server (or whatever URL your flask server is locally hosted): ```"proxy":"http://127.0.0.1:5000/"``` 
3. Create a ```.env``` file in the root directory of the frontend folder and add your project id in the file: ```REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID```

<br> 

### Backend Setup

1. To get all the required ids and information to setup the backend, first make sure that you have a descope project
2. Create two different [tenants](https://app.descope.com/tenants) called "Teachers" and "Students." A tenant is just a way of organizing a group of users who share similar characteristics 
3. Add your [roles](https://app.descope.com/authorization). Create two different roles called "teacher" and "student" <br>
4. Create a ```.env``` file and inside the backend folder and add your project id, student tenant id, and teacher tenant id in  the file:  
    ```
    PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
    STUDENT_TENANT_ID=YOUR_STUDENT_TENANT_ID
    TEACHER_TENANT_ID=YOUR_STUDENT_TENANT_ID
    ```
5. cd into backend folder and setup using the command: ```make setup``` <br>
This will create a virtual environment and install all dependencies for you.

<br>

## Running the Application üí°

- cd into backend: ```flask run```
- run the frontend/client: ```npm run client``` 
    - You can also cd into the frontend folder and start it as well: ```npm start```

<br>

## Folder Structure üìÅ

- backend: the backend folder contains the flask app and server that will handle session validation 
    - app.py: our main flask app (server)
    - requirements.txt: a txt file with a list of our dependencies
- frontend: our react app

### How do I get started with Descope?
If you don't have a Descope project or unsure what a project ID is, check out the [docs](https://docs.descope.com/build/guides/gettingstarted/)

### What is Flask?
Flask is a light-weight framework written in Python. It's super simple to get your web app started and running using Flask with just a couple of lines. To learn the basics of Flask, check out the official [documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/quickstart/)<br>
