# Flask + Descope Authentication (and a little bit of React) 

Using the Python framework Flask + React.js + Descope Python SDK to add and manage basic authentication and roles. The project will feature multiple pages, protected routes, and logout functionality. 

<br>

## Installing Dependencies üõ†Ô∏è

In the root directory of the project, run the following to install all dependencies: ```npm run setup```

### Client Setup

1. Create a ```.env``` file in the root directory of the `client` folder and add your Descope [Project ID](https://app.descope.com/settings/project) in the file: ```REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID=DESCOPE_PROJECT_ID```

> **NOTE**: If you're running your flask server on a different port than 5000, change the ```"proxy":"http://127.0.0.1:5000/"``` value to wherever your server is hosted. You can edit the proxy value in your client package.json file. 

<br> 

### Server Setup

Since this app also showcases roles, it will require you to set them up in the Descope Console.

1. Create two different [roles]((https://app.descope.com/authorization)) called "teacher" and "student" <br>
2. Create a ```.env``` file in the server folder and add your project id in the file:  
    ```
    PROJECT_ID=<DESCOPE_PROJECT_ID>
    ```

<br>

## Running the Application üí°

Have at least 2 different terminals open, one command for each terminal. Run the following commands in the project root directory.
- To run the server: ```npm run server```
- To run the client: ```npm run client``` 

<br>

## Folder Structure üìÅ

- Server: the server folder contains the flask app and server that will handle session validation 
    - `app.py`: our main flask app 
    - `requirements.txt`: a txt file with a list of our dependencies
- Client: our react app
